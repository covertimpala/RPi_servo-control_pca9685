# RPi_servo-control_pca9685
raspberry pi 180Â° servo control using pca9685

### Requirements
Requires you to have the [adafruit servokit library](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/servokit/en/latest/) installed

You also need to [configure i2c on your raspberry pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c)

### Usage
Run `main.py` and type the number of the pin that the servo you wish to control is connected to eg. 0

Once you have done that it will reply with `choose angle`. Type the appropriate angle and hit enter, the selected servo should move to the specified angle.


### EMG
EMG (Electromyography) is used to measure the muscles response to electrical signals.
In this project the EMG signals are used to control a robotic arm.

### Setup:

The setup used here is an Arduino Uno, RPi, two myoware EMG sensors and a PCA9685 along with six servos labeled 0 - 5.

#### Connecting RPi and PCA9685:
```
3.3v - vcc
GPIO 2 (SDA) - SDA
GPIO 3 (SCL) - SCL
GND - GND
```

### To connect Arduino UNO and myoware sensors please refer to [this manual](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Biometric/MyowareUserManualAT-04-001.pdf)

# To avoid risk of electric shock please use an isolated circuit

Upload the measurements.ino file to the Arduino and connect the myoware sensors to pins A0 and A1.

Once that is complete activate the RPi and install the files from this repository.

Open the terminal on the RPi and type `ls /dev/tty*`, then plug the Arduino Uno to the RPi using a USB cable and repeat the command. Find the device that should now have appeared and remember it!

Open serial_comm.py and replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the name you got.

Run serial_comm.py and check if any errors occur.

(if you encounter any errors or need a more detailed guide please refer to [this tutorial](https://roboticsbackend.com/raspberry-pi-arduino-serial-communication/))

If no errors occur then you can open main.py and run it, then type `calibrate` and follow the instructions that appear.

### EMG Commands
`calibrate` - calibrates software so that you get better control (NOTE: This command has to be typed in first for other EMG commands to work)

`emg on` - Activates EMG sensing for robotic arm

`emg off` - Deactivates EMG sensing for robotic arm
